            <h3>Why Korean?</h3>
            <h2>Why Hangul was created.</h2>
            <p>
              The Korean writing system of Hangeul (also written as Hangul) was
              created in 1443 by King Sejong the Great. It is the only language
              where the origin can be pinpointed to a specific start date.
              Before Hangul, Koreans used the Chinese writing system. This meant
              that written and spoken Korean were different, and many found the
              Chinese writing system hard to understand. King Sejong created
              Hangeul using the shapes that parts of the body create to make the
              sounds that they represent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hangeul is a syllabic alphabet, meaning letters are combined to
              form syllables. Each syllable is represented by a block of
              letters. The script was designed to be accessible and easy to
              learn for all Koreans, regardless of their social standing or
              education. Hangeul revolutionised Korean literacy and played a
              significant role in the development of Korean culture.
