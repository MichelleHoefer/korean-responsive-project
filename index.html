            <h3>Why Korean?</h3>
            <h2>Why Hangul was created.</h2>
            <p>
              The Korean writing system of Hangeul (also written as Hangul) was
              created in 1443 by King Sejong the Great. It is the only language
              where the origin can be pinpointed to a specific start date.
              Before Hangul, Koreans used the Chinese writing system. This meant
              that written and spoken Korean were different, and many found the
              Chinese writing system hard to understand. King Sejong created
              Hangeul using the shapes that parts of the body create to make the
              sounds that they represent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hangeul is a syllabic alphabet, meaning letters are combined to
              form syllables. Each syllable is represented by a block of
              letters. The script was designed to be accessible and easy to
              learn for all Koreans, regardless of their social standing or
              education. Hangeul revolutionised Korean literacy and played a
              significant role in the development of Korean culture.

                  K-pop emerged in the early 1990s, initially influenced by
                  Western music but developing its own distinct style. K-pop is
                  known for its striking visual elements, including music
                  videos, stage performances, and the overall aesthetic of the
                  artists and groups. The rise of the internet and social media
                  has played a significant role in K-pop's global reach and fan
                  engagement. K-pop's strong fan base is heavily engaged online,
                  utilizing social media and online platforms to support their
                  favorite artists and contribute to the genre's popularity.

                  One of the most popular Korean TV series is Squid Game, which
                  has become very popular globally. Squid Game is a dystopian
                  survival thriller horror television series on Netflix where
                  participants, facing dire financial hardship, are invited to
                  participate in a deadly series of children's games for a
                  chance at a large cash prize. These games, inspired by
                  traditional Korean children's games like the namesake "squid
                  game" (ojingeo), have deadly consequences for those who lose.
